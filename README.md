# Li-ion Battery Charger
This is a Circuit that can charge 4 li-ion cells at a time also this can be connected with another PCB and chained to charge upto 20 cells at a time with 1A. It also has A volatge monitor to keep a check on the voltage level. 
for Cost effectiveness this board uses existing TP4056 modules since the are easily available and also have all teh required protection that are needed.

## Parts used
- Lithium ion battery holder
- TP4056 modules
- 5v 20A Supply for providing enough power to charger the cells
- Voltmeter
- 16 AWG wires for chaining the PCBs
- 2 Fans 8025
