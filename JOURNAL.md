## 11/9/2025 12 PM - Planning  

My plan is to make a PCB where i can charger 4 lithium ion cells at a time and the PCB will be such that we can connect the PCBs together to charge as many lithium cells as possible just that we need to keep in mind the main power supply that is being used to charge them.

- i will be using TP4056 modules for this since using the ICs will end up costing more.
- will be first testing with 20 cells(4 cell per pcb and 5pcbs from JLC).
- 5v 20A supply with a inline fuse 
- U shape terminal connector with some 10-12 AWG wires.
- the system will have its own protections like reverse polarity fuse for over current and also a small voltmeter to monitor the supply voltage.
- resettable poly fuses for each board 
- acrylic base and mounted using stand offs
- proper heat dissipation using the copper pour and some thermal paste and small heat sinks for the ICs and a single 80mm fan to blow air over the row

## 11/9/2025 6 PM - Made schematic and completed the parts reserach   

The schematic is pretty simple one didn't take much time tbh it has a 5a fuse on the board and using Terminal block for connecting to the supply and to the other boards. Also has a small reverse polarity protection. 

also for the heat dissipation i am thinking of using a large copper pour above which the Module will sit and some thermal paste b/w them for better heat conduction.

also Fans  will be there 2 8025 5v fan to blow air over the modules to make the system run cooler 

all the PCBs will sit on a Acrylic Base over some 20mm M3 standoffs 

here is very vague representation of the system

## 11/9/2025 9 PM - Completed the PCB   

Completed routing the PCB. spent the majority of the time finding the right footprint for the parts even had to create some foot prints myself for this. also finding the right 3d model for the parts took some time too. I wont need a cad for this since this will sit one a acrylic for proper ventilation.
