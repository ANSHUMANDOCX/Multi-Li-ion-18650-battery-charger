## 11/9/2025 - Planning  

My plan is to make a PCB where i can charger 4 lithium ion cells at a time and the PCB will be such that we can connect the PCBs together to charge as many lithium cells as possible just that we need to keep in mind the main power supply that is being used to charge them.

- i will be using TP4056 modules for this since using the ICs will end up costing more.
- will be first testing with 20 cells(4 cell per pcb and 5pcbs from JLC).
- 5v 20A supply with a inline fuse 
- U shape terminal connector with some 10-12 AWG wires.
- the system will have its own protections like reverse polarity fuse for over current and also a small voltmeter to monitor the supply voltage.
- resettable poly fuses for each board 
- acrylic base and mounted using stand offs
- proper heat dissipation using the copper pour and some thermal paste and small heat sinks for the ICs and a single 80mm fan to blow air over the row
